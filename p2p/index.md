Peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms are online sites that match lenders to borrowers. At this basic level they are much like banks. However, unlike banks, P2P platforms usually do not invest these funds solely at their own discretion.  Instead some enable investors to directly make investment decisions by choosing the borrowers they fund or allowing investors to define the general social or financial features of the projects in which they want to invest. As a rule of thumb, the specific relationships made between investors and borrowers on P2P platforms are more transparent then when those relationships are indirectly constituted through banks.
 
P2P lending is basically a loan agreement between two individuals at an agreed interest rate. Zopa and Ratesetter focus on personal loans whereas Funding Circle is based on investors lending money to a business. This is different from crowd-funding, where investors give money to a business in exchange for equity or a discount on services. P2P lending is solely based on lending money and receiving a return on that loan, whereas crowd-funding is based on funding a business to grow with no immediate or direct repayment.

P2P lending is due to be regulated in 2014 and will fall under the [Financial Conduct Authority](http://www.fca.org.uk/). On average P2P lending has a much lower level of bad debt compared to other markets and investments. Zopa has a bad debt level of 0.31% which is the lowest of any financial provider in the UK and the lowest among the [P2P Finance Association](http://www.p2pfinanceassociation.org.uk/) members including RateSetter and Funding Circle.
