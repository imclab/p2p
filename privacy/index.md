### Personal data
The P2P data derives mostly from individuals and hence counts as personal data. To avoid re-identification of individuals we completed the following three steps:

1. Publish the data without postcodes or other direct identifiers.
2. Omitted all variables which are not relevant to this study such as sector or purpose
3. Conducted a privacy impact assessment (see below) 

### Screening questions

1. Does the project involve new or inherently privacy-invasive technologies?
2. Is the justification for the new data-handling unclear or unpublished?
3. Does the project involve an additional use of an existing identifier?
4. Does the project involve use of a new identifier for multiple purposes?
5. Does the project involve new or substantially changed identity authentication requirements that may be intrusive or onerous?
 6. Will the project result in the handling of a significant amount of new data about each person, or significant change in existing data-holdings?
7. Will the project result in the handling of new data about a significant number of people, or a significant change in the population coverage?
8. Does the project involve new linkage of personal data with data in other collections, or significant change in data linkages?
9. Does the project involve new or changed data collection policies or practices that may be unclear or intrusive?
10. Does the project involve new or changed data quality assurance processes and standards that may be unclear or unsatisfactory?
11. Does the project involve new or changed data security arrangements that may be unclear or unsatisfactory?
12. Does the project involve new or changed data access or disclosure arrangements that may be unclear or permissive?
13. Does the project involve new or changed data retention arrangements that may be unclear or extensive?
14. Does the project involve changing the medium of disclosure for publicly available information in such a way that the data becomes more readily accessible than before?
Exemptions
15. Will the project give rise to new or changed data-handling that is in any way exempt from legislative privacy protections?

Anonymisation: managing data protection risk code of practice

> For example, in England, when anonymising postcodes the following average characteristics of postcodes should be considered:
> * full postcode = approx 15 households (although some postcodes only relate to a single property)
> * postcode minus the last digit = approx 120/200 households 
> * postal sector = 4  outbound digits + 1 inbound gives approx 2,600 households 
> * postal district = 4 outbound digits approx 8,600 households 
> * postal area = 2 outbound digits approx 194,000 households

full postcode = approx 15 households (although some postcodes only relate to a single property) 

postal area = 2 outbound digits approx 194,000 households 
postal district = 4 outbound digits approx 8,600 households
