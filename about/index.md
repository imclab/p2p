## Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

George Michael may be suffering from what we in the soft-sciences call Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, or the "OC Disorder." There's been a lot of lying in this family. And a lot of love! More lies. Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we. No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being WITH you. Up yours, granny! You couldn't handle it! I hear the jury's still out on science.

### Teamocil

Teamocil. It was for me. I was going to smoke the marijuana like a cigarette. I want to cry so bad, but I don't think I can spare the moisture. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. Michael: It's just Mom and whores. Yeah, I invited her. You said you wanted to spend time some with her. You said I was being an Ann hog. Come on, this is a Bluth family celebration. It's no place for children. Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. Michael: It's just Mom and whores.

Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. They want to break his legs. It's a good thing he's already got that little scooter. I'm a scholar. I enjoy scholarly pursuits. Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit? He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same. Early.
